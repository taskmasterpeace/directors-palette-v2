# Standardize Auth Form Input Styling

## Overview

Update authentication forms (SignInForm, ForgotPasswordForm, ResetPasswordForm) to use the standard Input component instead of custom inline styling

## Rationale

Auth forms use custom inline focus styles (focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 or focus:ring-amber-500) that don't match the design system's Input component. This creates visual inconsistency and maintenance burden.

  "task_description": "# User Prompts Organization System\n\nImplement the user_prompts table and UI for saving, organizing, and reusing prompts. Allow users to create folders, add tags, and quickly search their prompt library.\n\n## Rationale\nPower users create hundreds of prompts during a project. Without organization, they waste time recreating prompts or searching through history. This addresses the repetitive prompt work pain point shared across all competitors (pain-1-4, pain-3-4).\n\n## User Stories\n- As a storyboard artist, I want to save my best prompts so that I can reuse them for similar scenes\n- As a comic creator, I want to organize prompts by project so that I can quickly find the right prompt for each series\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Users can save prompts with custom names and descriptions\n- [ ] Users can organize prompts into folders\n- [ ] Users can add tags to prompts for filtering\n- [ ] Quick search finds prompts by name, content, or tags\n- [ ] One-click loads saved prompt into Shot Creator\n",

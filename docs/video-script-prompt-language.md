# Director's Palette — The Prompting Language
### Video Script (60 seconds)

**THE CHARACTER:** Kenzo — a Black samurai with long freeform dreadlocks, a sharp jawline, and a scar across his left eyebrow. He wears weathered black and crimson armor with gold detailing. Distinct. Unmistakable. He's in every scene.

---

**[0:00 - 0:05] HOOK**

*Quick cuts of Kenzo in 4 different worlds — bamboo forest, neon city, claymation, comic book — same character, completely different styles. Each image snaps in hard.*

> Most AI tools give you one prompt, one image. Director's Palette gives you a language.

---

**[0:05 - 0:15] BATCH VARIATIONS — Brackets**

*Screen shows the prompt being typed. Three images of Kenzo generate and land side by side — same man, three different environments.*

> Brackets are your first power move. Wrap your options in brackets, separated by commas — and Director's Palette generates every variation at once.

*On screen:*
```
Kenzo, a samurai with dreadlocks in [a bamboo forest, a neon city, a desert storm]
```

> One prompt. Three worlds. That's Batch Variations.

---

**[0:15 - 0:22] SEPARATE PROMPTS — Pipes**

*Three images of Kenzo appear in sequence like storyboard frames — walking into a courtyard, drawing his blade, standing victorious over a fallen opponent.*

> Pipes tell a story. Each section is its own scene, its own generation.

*On screen:*
```
Kenzo walks into the courtyard | he draws his blade | he stands victorious
```

> Three acts. One line.

---

**[0:22 - 0:32] ANCHOR TRANSFORM — @!**

*Show the claymation style reference being uploaded alongside a photorealistic image of Kenzo. The @! is typed. Result: Kenzo transformed into claymation — same dreads, same scar, same armor, but clay.*

> This one changes everything. Upload a style reference and your images. Add the @-bang. Your first image becomes the anchor — every other image transforms to match it.

*On screen:*
```
@! Transform into claymation style
```

> One anchor. Unlimited transformations.

---

**[0:32 - 0:40] RANDOM PICKS — Wildcards**

*Show the wildcard list briefly, then two images of Kenzo — one in modern streetwear in a recording studio, one in ceremonial robes on a mountaintop.*

> Wildcards keep it fresh. Build lists of wardrobe, locations, lighting — anything. Wrap the name in underscores, and Director's Palette pulls a random pick every time you generate.

*On screen:*
```
Kenzo wearing _wardrobe_ standing in _location_
```

*Wildcard lists flash briefly:*
```
_wardrobe_: black and gold streetwear, vintage kimono, ceremonial armor
_location_: a foggy mountaintop, a neon-lit alley, a burning temple
```

> Same character. Same prompt. Never the same image.

---

**[0:40 - 0:48] AI EXPANDS — Slot Machine**

*Show the prompt with curly braces, then the wand button click, then the braces morphing into bracket variations. Three images of Kenzo in different lighting.*

> Stuck on ideas? Curly braces hand it to the AI. Write a seed, hit the wand, and it expands into creative variations you never would have typed yourself.

*On screen (before):*
```
Kenzo meditating in {dramatic lighting}
```

*On screen (after):*
```
Kenzo meditating in [candlelit temple glow, lightning storm silhouette, golden hour through paper screens]
```

> Your seed. The AI's imagination.

---

**[0:48 - 0:55] IMAGE REFERENCES — @Tags**

*Show typing @kenzo and the autocomplete dropdown appearing with his character sheet thumbnail. Then a generated image that clearly matches his look — dreads, scar, armor.*

> Tag any image in your library with an @name. Use it in any prompt, and the AI keeps that face, that look — consistent across every single shot.

*On screen:*
```
@kenzo walking through a rainy village at night, lanterns swaying
```

> Your character. Every time.

---

**[0:55 - 1:00] THE STACK — Combine Everything**

*All syntax elements type out in one prompt line, left to right. A grid of Kenzo images fills the screen — different locations, different wardrobe, all unmistakably him.*

> And here's the real magic — stack all of them. References, wildcards, brackets, pipes. One line. An entire shoot.

*On screen:*
```
@kenzo wearing _wardrobe_ in [a rooftop, a temple, a battlefield] | the army charges
```

*Beat. Images fill the screen.*

> This is Director's Palette.

*Logo. End card.*

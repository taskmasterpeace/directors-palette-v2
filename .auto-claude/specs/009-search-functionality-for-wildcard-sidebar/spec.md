# Search Functionality for Wildcard Sidebar

## Overview

Add real-time search filtering to the wildcard sidebar, allowing users to quickly find wildcards by name, category, or content.

## Rationale

The usePromptFilters.ts hook implements search/filter for prompts with useMemo-based filtering. WildcardSidebar.tsx currently just lists all wildcards without search, becoming unwieldy as collection grows.

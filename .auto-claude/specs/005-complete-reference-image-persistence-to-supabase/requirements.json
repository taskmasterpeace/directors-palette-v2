  "task_description": "Reference images and reference tags  are critical for character consistency - the #1 differentiator. Without reliable persistence, users lose their work and the @reference syntax becomes unreliable. This addresses competitor pain points where users struggle with character consistency (Midjourney pain-1-2, DALL-E pain-3-2).\n\nCurrently. When you do the at symbol there are two auto completes that show up. As you can see in the screenshot. You can see one in the front and then you'll see one in the back there that is a lot wider than the other one. We need to resolve this and we need to clean up our system and make it easier to use. I don't know what. Like you should have to add it into the library. In order to add A tag to it like you should be able, you should have to save it into the library before adding a reference tag.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a comic artist, I want my character references to persist so that I can continue my project across multiple sessions\n- As a visual storyteller, I want to access my references from any device so that I can work from my home and office\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Reference images are uploaded to Supabase Storage on save\n- [ ] Reference images persist across browser sessions\n- [ ] Reference images sync across devices for logged-in users\n- [ ] Reference image URLs are valid and accessible in prompts\n- [ ] Deleted references are cleaned up from storage",

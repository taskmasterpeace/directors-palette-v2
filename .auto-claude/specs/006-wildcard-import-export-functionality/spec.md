# Wildcard Import/Export Functionality

## Overview

Add JSON import and export capabilities for wildcards, enabling users to backup their custom wildcards and share them with the community.

## Rationale

Same pattern as prompts exists in usePromptImportExport.ts. Wildcards in wildcard.store.ts have full CRUD (createWildCard, updateWildCard, deleteWildCard) but no import/export. Users cannot backup or share their wildcards.

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation plan for a **Story Project System** that transforms battle rap documentary transcripts into organized, reference-tagged scene prompts for image generation. The system will analyze story text, extract characters and locations, generate scene prompts per story (one shot per sentence/clause), and organize them by chapter/section - all without automatic image generation.

**Key Objectives**:
- Automate extraction of characters, locations, and visual scenes from story transcripts
- Generate organized, reference-tagged prompts ready for image generation
- Provide complete control over prompt refinement before generation
- Support reusable character/location references across scenes
- Enable project-based workflow with save/load capabilities
- High-density shot creation: one shot per sentence/clause (~180-220 shots per 10-minute story)

**Target Users**: Content creators producing visual documentaries, graphic novels, and sequential storytelling content.

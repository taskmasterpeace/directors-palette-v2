# Add Visual Drop Zone Feedback for File Uploads

## Overview

Implement prominent visual feedback when users drag files over upload areas, with clear valid/invalid file type indicators

## Rationale

Modern creative tools provide clear drag-and-drop feedback. Without visible drop zones, users may not discover drag-and-drop is supported or may be unsure where to drop files.

Enable Shift+click for range selection and Ctrl+click for toggle selection.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe selection pattern exists in usePromptSelection.ts with Set-based tracking and selectAll/toggleSelect callbacks. BulkDownloadService handles ZIP creation. These can be combined with the existing gallery grid for powerful bulk operations.\n\n---\n*This spec was created from ideation and is pending detailed specification.*\n",

Project: Fix Mobile Layout Issues in Prompt Tools UI
Spec Number: 015
Workspace: Managed by orchestrator
Started: 2025-12-25

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: Targeted fix for existing functionality involving CSS/layout modifications across
multiple components in a single service. Requires systematic changes to responsive breakpoints,
flexbox/grid configurations, and container sizing across the Prompt Tools feature.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Completed deep codebase investigation
- Created implementation_plan.json with 6 phases, 11 subtasks
- Created context.json with files to modify and patterns
- Created init.sh for development environment
- Created this progress tracking document

Phase Summary:
1. Tab Navigation Mobile Fix: 1 subtask, no dependencies
   - Fix PromptToolsPage.tsx tabs (hide text/badges on mobile)

2. Recipes Tab Mobile Fix: 3 subtasks, depends on phase-1
   - Fix RecipeBuilder.tsx header (collapse buttons to dropdown)
   - Fix recipe cards layout (proper stacking)
   - Fix create/edit dialog (mobile scrollable)

3. Library Tab Mobile Fix: 2 subtasks, depends on phase-1
   - Fix PromptLibraryCard.tsx header (5+ buttons to dropdown)
   - Fix category grid and prompt cards

4. Wildcards Tab Mobile Fix: 2 subtasks, depends on phase-1
   - Fix WildCardManager.tsx grid (single column on xs screens)
   - Fix create/edit dialog

5. Styles Tab Mobile Fix: 2 subtasks, depends on phase-1
   - Fix StyleSelector.tsx layout (flex wrapping)
   - Fix create custom style dialog

6. Integration & Verification: 2 subtasks, depends on phases 2-5
   - End-to-end verification at 375px, 428px, 768px
   - Verify Gallery code untouched

Services Involved:
- main (Next.js frontend with Tailwind CSS)

Files to Modify:
- src/features/prompt-tools/components/PromptToolsPage.tsx
- src/features/shot-creator/components/creator-prompt-settings/PromptToolsTabs.tsx
- src/features/shot-creator/components/recipe/RecipeBuilder.tsx
- src/features/shot-creator/components/creator-prompt-settings/PromptLibraryCard.tsx
- src/features/shot-creator/components/wildcard/WildCardManager.tsx
- src/features/shot-creator/components/creator-prompt-settings/StyleSelector.tsx

Patterns to Apply:
- hidden md:flex for desktop buttons, flex md:hidden with DropdownMenu for mobile
- hidden sm:inline for text labels on tabs
- grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 for responsive grids
- max-w-[calc(100%-2rem)] sm:max-w-md for mobile dialogs

Constraints:
- DO NOT modify any Gallery-related files
- Maintain desktop layout unchanged
- Use Tailwind responsive classes only

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 4 (phases 2-5 can run simultaneously)
- Recommended workers: 2
- Speedup estimate: 2x faster than sequential

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 015 --parallel 2

Or manually:

  npm run dev
  # Open browser to http://localhost:3000
  # Use Chrome DevTools mobile viewport (375px)
  # Navigate to Prompt Tools section

# Director's Palette — Characters & Styles
### Video Script (60-75 seconds)

**THREAD:** Kenzo is back from Video 1. This video shows how he was built — the character sheet that keeps him consistent — and how styles transform his entire world. By the end, the viewer understands: character sheets lock the *who*, style sheets lock the *look*.

---

**[0:00 - 0:05] HOOK**

*Split screen: Left side shows 3 images of the SAME character (Kenzo) in different scenes — consistent look. Right side shows 3 images of DIFFERENT characters that don't match — inconsistent, generic AI output.*

> AI gives you a new face every time. Unless you give it a character sheet.

---

**[0:05 - 0:18] CHARACTER SHEETS — Lock the Look**

*Screen recording: Entities tab, Kenzo's character card expanding. Show the description being typed, then the "Generate Character Sheet" button being clicked. The turnaround sheet appears — front, side, back, 3/4 views.*

> A character sheet is your character's blueprint. Describe them — or upload a reference — and Director's Palette generates a turnaround. Front view, side view, back view, expressions. Every angle the AI needs to keep them consistent.

*On screen: The generated character sheet — Kenzo from multiple angles.*

> This is Kenzo. Dreadlocks. Scar. Crimson armor. Now the AI knows exactly who he is.

---

**[0:18 - 0:28] USE IT EVERYWHERE**

*Show the @kenzo tag being typed into a prompt. Three different images generate — different scenes, same Kenzo.*

> Tag your character sheet with an @name. Now every prompt that uses @kenzo pulls from this sheet. Different scene, different angle — same character.

*On screen:*
```
@kenzo standing on a cliff at dawn
@kenzo fighting in a burning temple
@kenzo sitting in a tea house, quiet moment
```

*Three images appear — all unmistakably Kenzo.*

> Three prompts. One face. That's the power of a character sheet.

---

**[0:28 - 0:35] BRING YOUR OWN**

*Screen recording: Character card, toggle Reference on, click Upload. A premade character sheet image (designed in another tool) drops in. It appears as the reference thumbnail.*

> Already have a character sheet? Upload it. Designed it in Photoshop, MidJourney, wherever — drop it in and it works the same way. Or browse your gallery and pick one you generated before.

*Show the gallery picker opening with the "Character Sheets" filter badge active.*

> Your characters, your way.

---

**[0:35 - 0:48] STYLE SHEETS — Set the World**

*Quick montage: same Kenzo prompt, but 4 different preset styles applied — claymation, blade runner, comic book, action figure. Each image snaps in.*

> Characters lock the who. Styles lock the look. Pick a preset — claymation, blade runner, comic book — and every shot in your project gets that treatment.

*Screen recording: Style tab, clicking through preset style cards. Each one shows a preview image and the style name.*

*On screen — show 4 Kenzo images:*
```
Claymation Kenzo — clay fingerprints, miniature set
Blade Runner Kenzo — neon rain, anamorphic flares
Comic Book Kenzo — ink outlines, halftone dots
Action Figure Kenzo — plastic joints, diorama
```

> Same character. Completely different universes.

---

**[0:48 - 0:55] CUSTOM STYLES**

*Screen recording: Style tab, creating a custom style guide — typing a name, writing a style prompt, uploading a reference image.*

> Don't see your style? Build your own. Name it, describe it, drop in a reference image — and Director's Palette applies it everywhere.

*On screen:*
```
Style: "Feudal Ink Wash"
Prompt: traditional Japanese ink wash painting, sumi-e brushwork,
        minimal color, rice paper texture
```

*Show Kenzo rendered in ink wash style — dramatic, minimal, beautiful.*

> Your world. Your rules.

---

**[0:55 - 1:05] CHARACTER + STYLE = CONSISTENCY**

*Full screen grid: Kenzo in 6 different shots, all in the same custom ink wash style. Different scenes — fighting, meditating, walking through rain, standing on a cliff — but all visually cohesive.*

> This is what it all comes together for. One character sheet. One style guide. Every shot in your project looks like it belongs in the same film.

*On screen:*
```
Character: @kenzo — locks the face, the armor, the dreads
Style: Feudal Ink Wash — locks the brushwork, the palette, the texture
Result: A world that feels real
```

> Character sheets and style sheets. The foundation of everything you build in Director's Palette.

*Logo. End card.*

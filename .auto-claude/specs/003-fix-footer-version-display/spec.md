# Fix Footer Version Display

## Overview

Update the footer version from hardcoded 'v0.8' to dynamically read from package.json or update to match current version 0.95.0

## Rationale

The footer displays 'v0.8' but the actual application version in package.json is '0.95.0'. This misleads users about the current version and looks unprofessional.

  "task_description": "OK. There are a couple issues with what's going on right now. When I go to prompt tools, for example the recipes library, wild card, and styles on mobile like it's all bunched up. You really can't see it or whatever. And styles style doesn't let you create another style here. You should be able to create the custom styles and I suppose you just plug in the variable. Wild cars don't look good on mobile, but at least you can scroll the whole bottom of the of the screen. When you go to in library is all messed up to like it's the words are off of the off of the thing. I don't know if you even need to put the words up here, but they're they're off of the the column that they're on and even the buttons like Expert Import at that's way Office. That's like really off right there. And then recipes. You just can't see the right side of it like you can only just like stuck on the left, but it's still stuff that it feels like it's off screen to the right. And that's important to be able to use the Prompt tools. Gallery was fixed earlier. One issue, but now we're having a different issue. So there is a issue with the gallery. So you wanna stay away from the gallery 'cause that code is gonna change and we don't want any conflicts. But the prompt tools was really where the issue is right now.",

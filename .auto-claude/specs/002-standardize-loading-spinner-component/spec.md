# Standardize Loading Spinner Component

## Overview

Create a unified LoadingSpinner component and replace inconsistent loading indicators throughout the app

## Rationale

Different components use varying loading indicators - some use Loader2 with amber color, others use custom border-based spinners with purple, and some have different sizes. This creates visual inconsistency.
